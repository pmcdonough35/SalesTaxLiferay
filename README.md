# SalesTaxLiferay

## Description 

This program calculates the sales tax of a list of purchased items. When someone purchase items, they receive a receipt which lists the name of all the items and their price (including tax), finishing with the total cost of the items, and the total amounts of sales taxes paid. The rounding rules for sales tax are that for a tax rate of n%, a shelf price of p contains (np/100 rounded up to the nearest 0.05) amount of sales tax.


## Assumptions 

I assumed that the user would input their purchases one by one in the order of the example (quantity, name, price). Also, I assumed they would input if the item was imported/exempt.
